# Things I Am Learning (TIL)

This repository is a collection of concise write-ups on small things I learn day to day across a variety of languages and technologies. These are things that don't really warrant a full blog post.

## Motivation

The idea of this repository is to break the never-ending cycle of consuming to creation. It's easy to spend hours reading and consuming information, but this is my attempt to create something out of what I learn.

## Contributing

I welcome contributions from everyone. If you've learned something interesting and want to share it, please feel free to open a PR.
