# relearning pytorch
I have lost touch with pytorch for a while now.
here I would be working on small toy examples of different aspect of model training.

Goal is to grasp and get mastery over basic training runs of ML models using pytorch, 
get comfortable with using pytorch. understand its tools and minor details
