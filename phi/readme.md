# Phi - opensource assistant equivalent of OPENAI's implementation

Looks very interesting

Installing

```
pip install -U phidata
```

And Looks like opensource model heremes Pro works very well. I am surprised. 
I will try the same with Instructor to see how that works.
This framework can be used to create a synthatic dataset
